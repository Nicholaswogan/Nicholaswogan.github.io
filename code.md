# Released

[**PhotochemPy**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/PhotochemPy)<br />
A photochemical-climate model of planet's atmospheres. Given inputs, like the stellar UV flux, the atmospheric temperature structure, etc., this code will find the steady-state chemical composition of an atmosphere, or evolve atmospheres through time. PhotochemPy is [published in a paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2205618119) about the rise of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere.

[**numbalsoda**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/numblsoda)<br />
A Python package for solving oridinary differential equation initial value problems. The package leverages [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) to achieve computation speeds as fast as C, and is [>10 times faster than Scipy](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/numblsoda/tree/main/benchmark).

[**NumbaMinpack**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/NumbaMinpack)<br />
A Python package for solving system of non-linear equations using [MINPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINPACK). 

[**fortran-yaml-c**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/fortran-yaml-c)<br />
A YAML parser for Fortran.

[**odepack**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/odepack)<br />
A Modern Fortran interface to a refactored version of ODEPACK, which is for solving ordinary differential equation initial value problems.

# Under construction

[**photochem**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/photochem)<br />
An updated version of PhotochemPy, which has been re-written from the ground-up.

[**clima**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/clima)<br />
A radiative transfer code and a climate model.
