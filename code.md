[**photochem**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/photochem)<br />
A one-dimensional photochemical-climate model of planet's atmospheres. Given inputs, like the stellar UV flux, planetary mass, etc., this code will find the steady-state chemical composition of an atmosphere, or evolve atmospheres through time. This code was first published in this paper: [https://doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/aced83](https://doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/aced83).

[**PhotochemPy**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/PhotochemPy)<br />
An older version of `photochem`. PhotochemPy is [published in a paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2205618119) about the rise of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere.

[**clima**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/clima)<br />
A one-dimensional radiative transfer code and a suite of climate models. The radiative transfer code uses the correlated-k technique and is designed to be most useful for climate calculations, rather than simulating telescope spectra. The code contains several different climate models of varying complexity. This code was first published in this paper: [https://doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/aced83](https://doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/aced83).

[**VolcGases**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/VolcGases)<br />
The code calculates the gases produced by a volcano. The code was is [published in a paper](https://doi.org/DOI:10.3847/PSJ/abb99e) about whether volcanos on exoplanets can make methane or not.

[**numbalsoda**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/numblsoda)<br />
A Python package for solving ordinary differential equation initial value problems. The package leverages [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) to achieve computation speeds as fast as C, and is [>10 times faster than Scipy](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/numblsoda/tree/main/benchmark).

[**NumbaMinpack**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/NumbaMinpack)<br />
A Python package for solving system of non-linear equations using [MINPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINPACK). 

[**fortran-yaml-c**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/fortran-yaml-c)<br />
A YAML parser for Fortran.

[**odepack**](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/odepack)<br />
A Modern Fortran interface to a refactored version of ODEPACK, which is for solving ordinary differential equation initial value problems.
