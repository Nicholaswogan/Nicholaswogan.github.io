# Hello!

I am a research graduate student in the [Earth and Space Sciences Department](https://www.ess.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I study planetary science and astrobiology.

This purpose of this website is to
1. Provide links to my peer-reviewed publications
2. Publish projects that I never managed to submit to a peer-reviewed journal.
